# par

A Clojure(Script) library designed to print-and-return values.

It will print what you are evaluating, and the result of evaluating it.

Intended to wrap existing values in your source code so they can be observed without changing the execution of the program.

## Usage

Add as a dependency to your project:

```clojure
[par "0.1.0"]
```

And setup your namespace imports:

```clojure
(ns my-cljs-ns
  (:require
    [par.core :refer-macros [? ?c]]))
```


## Printing

The `?` and `?c` macros give you `js/console.log` and `println`, respectively. Use `?c` if you are in a `.clj`, or `.cljc` file.

```clojure
(? (+ 1 2)) ; => 3

;; The above will print the following to js/console.log:
(+ 1 2)
=> 3
```
